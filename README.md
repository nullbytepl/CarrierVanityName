# Carrier Vanity Name
Carrier Vanity Name is a very simple app to change the carrier names on unrooted Android devices.

The changed names will persist through reboots. To revert them back, click the reset button in the app.

The app can also override the ISO country code of your SIM card. This can be useful to spoof your location to some region-locked apps like the Pixel Thermometer.

The app uses [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) to achieve this using carrier config overrides. This method was inspired by Kyujin Cho's [pixel-volte-patch](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/pixel-volte-patch), which uses the same method to enable VoLTE on some Google Pixel and LG devices.

**WARNING**: Anything using Shizuku might potentially cause harm to your device (and the data on it). I'm not responsible for any damage that might be caused by this app.
You have been warned.

# Examples
Some common carrier names you can spoof for if you're in the US can include: T-Mobile or Verizon
Some ISO country codes to spoof can also include: "us" (United States), "au" (Australia), "de" (Germany), "fr" (France), "in" (India)
P.S. The ISO country codes specifies to the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country code (aka 2 letter country codes)
